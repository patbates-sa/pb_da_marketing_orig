## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to run dbt locally on your Mac.

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Open **Terminal** and run:

```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Add these lines at the end of the file (replace the values with your own):

```bash
export DBT_SNOWFLAKE_USER="your_snowflake_sso_email"
export DBT_DEVELOPMENT_SCHEMA="dbt_yourname"
```

Save the file (**Cmd+S**) and close it. Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Verify Your Setup

Test your connection (a browser window will open for SSO login):

```bash
dbt debug
```

You should see "All checks passed!" if everything is configured correctly.
